Always wanted a bit more todo in Krastorio and [Extended Endgame](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/krastorio2_extended_endgame) isn't enough? Well now there is more.
This mod takes some nice mods and brings them in line to extend the Krastorio 2 endgame even more.

Added Krastorio intermediates to almost all the recipes of

* [Expanded Rocket Payloads Continued](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/expanded-rocket-payloads-continued) short ERPC
* [Space Extension Mod (SpaceX) Feoras Fork](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpaceModFeorasFork)
* [Orbital Ion Cannon](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Kux-OrbitalIonCannon)

All mods except ERPC are optional.
Space X needs to be configured before starting your save.
