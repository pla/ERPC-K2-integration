Always wanted a bit more todo in Krastorio and [Extended Endgame](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/krastorio2_extended_endgame) isn't enough? Well now there is more. 
This mod takes some nice mods and brings them in line to extend the Krastorio 2 endgame even more.

Added Krastorio intermediates to almost all the recipes of

*   [Expanded Rocket Payloads Continued](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/expanded-rocket-payloads-continued) short ERPC
*   [Space Extension Mod (SpaceX)](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpaceMod)
*   [Space Extension Mod (SpaceX) Feoras Fork](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpaceModFeorasFork)
*   [Orbital Ion Cannon](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Kux-OrbitalIonCannon)

Further correction's applied when used with

*   [Improved SpaceX FTL research reloaded](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/improved-spacex-ftl)
*   [Omniscience](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/omnimatter_science)

All mods except ERPC are optional. 
Space X needs to be configured before starting your save.
Omniscience needs to be enabled. The configuration of Omniscience can be adjusted at every point while playing, eg. if science goes too fast or too slow. I don't recommend to set an additional Tech price multiplier when playing with Omniscience.

This Mod is inspired by quindao's [Expanded Rocket Payloads Continued Touched by an AngelBob](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ERPCTbaAB)
