ERPC-K2-integration-integrate-spacex=Integrate SpaceX
ERPC-K2-integration-integrate-ioncannon=Integrate Ion Cannon
ERPC-K2-integration-refurbish-not-guaranteed=Should the Refurbished Rocket return be a percentage chance?
ERPC-K2-integration-refurbish-chance=How high should the refurbish chance be?
ERPC-K2-integration-use-k2-tiles=Use black reinforced plate from K2?
ERPC-K2-integration-adjust-defaults=Adjust default settings
ERPC-K2-integration-use-ftl-science=Use FTL science pack in final ERPC technology

ERPC-K2-integration-integrate-spacex=Should SpaceX recipes and technologies be altered to fit Expanded Rocket Payload more?
ERPC-K2-integration-integrate-ioncannon=Should Ion Cannon recipes and technologies be altered to fit Expanded Rocket Payload more?
ERPC-K2-integration-refurbish-not-guaranteed=Should the Refurbished Rocket return be a percentage chance? Unchecked means it gets always returned. Checked means the value below is used.
ERPC-K2-integration-refurbish-chance=How high should the refurbish chance be? (Default: 0.9 means 90% chance).
ERPC-K2-integration-use-k2-tiles=Instead of bricks
ERPC-K2-integration-adjust-defaults=TLDR-More rocket launches. SpaceX: Production cost x4, Launch Profile x5; K2EE: Initial Space research = 500
ERPC-K2-integration-use-ftl-science=The Improved SpaceX FTL research science is used in the Orbital Autonomouse Fabricator technology research. TLDR: More rockets need to be launched
